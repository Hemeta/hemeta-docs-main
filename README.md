# Introduction

## What is HemetaHeta?

[**HemetaHeta**](https://www.hemeta.net) is the first decentralized reserve memecoin protocol on **Polygon Network** based on the **HETA** token. Each **HETA** token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. MAI/QUICK/MATIC) in the Hemeta's treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. HemetaHeta also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.&#x20;

HemetaHeta is a fork of [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.net) on Polygon network.

## What is the point of HemetaHeta?

Most memecoins do not have any tokenomics built inside. Investors will suffer from large volatility and have a significant chance toward zero. The Hemeta King (or the world?) noticed that the OlympusDAO creates the strongest tokenomics of the DeFi world. We decide to bring the bonding and protocol-owned liquidity to the hemetaâ€™s kingdom!

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled memecoin system, in which the behavior of the **HETA** token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that **HETA** can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange _memecoin_. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I join the Hemeta family?

There are two main ways for hemeta lovers: [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding.md). Stakers stake their **HETA** tokens to hemetas in return for more **HETA** tokens, while bonders provide LP or MAI tokens in exchange for discounted **HETA** tokens after a fixed vesting period.

## How can I benefit from HemetaHeta?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The hemeta harvests new **HETA** tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers thanks for the **HETA** tokens they offered. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in **HETA** and thus the bonder's profit would depend on **HETA** price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static **HETA** price.

## Who created HemetaHeta?

HemetaHeta is a fork of OlympusDAO on the Polygon Network. Our team is mostly anonymous, born from the habitat of hemetas. We aim at becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

## Who runs HemetaHeta?

Currently, most of the decisions are taken by the core team, but we expect to be able to turn this into a DAO-governed model as soon as possible!
