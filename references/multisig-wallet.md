# Multisig Wallet

Our HemetaHeta DAO contract is guarded by a gnosis safe multisig implementation. The HemetaHeta DAO gnosis safe address will hold all the treasury funds accumulated. As an example, the HemetaHeta DAO receives profit from every bond and LP transaction by contract design.

Below is the HemetaHeta gnosis safe, where the latest version represents the currently active address.
