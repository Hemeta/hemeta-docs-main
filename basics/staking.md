# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of HemetaHeta.** Stakers stake their **HETA** tokens on [the HemetaHeta website](https://app.hemeta.finance/#/stake) to earn harvest rewards. The harvest rewards come from the proceed from [bond sales](https://docs.hemetaheta.finance/basics/bonding) and can vary based on the number of **HETA** tokens staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of **HETA** translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of HETA drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked HETA balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock HETA and receive an equal amount of sHETA.** Your sHETA balance harvests up automatically at the end of every epoch. sHETA is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sHETA and receive an equal amount of HETA.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming harvest reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked HETA (if any) will continue to receive harvest rewards.
