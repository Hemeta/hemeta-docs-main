## Treasury

The treasury contract is a simple vault implementation holding all the funds
collected by the protocol. If for instance a user purchases a MAI bond, the
bonded MAI is fully taken in by the treasury in return of the market equivalent
of HETA bonded for. New HETA will be minted based on the RFV of the treasury
assets. Below are listed treasury contracts by version, where the latest version
represents the currently active contract.
