# MAI Bond

MAI bond was introduced since HemetaHeta launch. It allows you to trade [MAI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai) in exchange for discounted HETA on HemetaHeta.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have MAI in your wallet. For example, you can [go to QuickSwap to swap for MAI](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=&outputCurrency=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [MAI Bond page of the HemetaHeta website](https://app.hemetaheta.finance/#/bonds/dai). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of MAI you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of HETA you can purchase.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the HemetaHeta contract to spend your MAI. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
